# Particle

Allows to connect your Particle.io devices to Homey.

Before adding a particle device you need to go to app settings and enter the API access token. If you don't know where to find the access token this [thread](https://community.particle.io/t/getting-finding-an-access-token/44084) may help.

Devices need to be online in order to be added to Homey.

## Triggers
- Device connected/disconnected
- A device connected/disconnected
- Device events

   All events generated by the device are issued to Homey as a trigger. Filtering of relevant events needs to done by using conditions.

## Conditions
- Variable value

## Actions
- Call function
- Publish event

## Settings
- Refresh interval (seconds)

   How frequently the device information is refreshed from the particle cloud to Homey.

- Enable device events as a trigger

   By default the Device events trigger is disabled. If your device issues events that you want to use as a trigger for flows then you need to enable this setting.
